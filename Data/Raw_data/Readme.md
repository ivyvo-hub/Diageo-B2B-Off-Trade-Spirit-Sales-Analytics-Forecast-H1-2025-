# Data Source & Structure
This project uses the **Iowa Department of Commerce’s open liquor sales dataset**, which records **retail-level (sell-out) transactions** under the state-controlled distribution model. In Iowa, all off-trade alcohol retailers must hold a liquor license, and every transaction is captured in the state’s commerce system. This ensures a complete and reliable view of actual spirits sell-out.

The dataset provides **transaction-level detail**, including product names, prices, quantities, and store locations across the state.

For this analysis, I focus on ~6 million Diageo transactions from 2023 to H1 2025 to evaluate YoY performance and assess H2 2025 growth opportunities.

The original dataset is published by the State of Iowa [here](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy).
